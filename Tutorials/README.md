# Tutorials

## Tutorial 1
- The notebook titled `Tutorial_1.ipynb` is an initial look at machine learning in general.
- Reviews how to fit data through linear regression.
- Introduces how to fit classes with logistic regression.
- Teaches you the mechanics to build your own Neural Network from scratch. (Well almost, we use `numpy` for matrix multiplication).
- The notebook uses Python3.
- Uses the following packages:
    - `numpy`
    - `matplotlib`
    - `sklearn` [https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html]

## Tutorial 2
- The notebook titled `Tutorial_2.ipynb` uses the keras package to quickly build and train networks.
- Examines the effects of different minimization algorithms and activation functions.
- Explores giving a network depth or width.
- Explains some of important/best practices:
    - Metrics for comparing results
    - Train/Validate/Test sets
    - Preprocessing
- Unlike tutorial 1, we do not have control over the random numbers here, so it is not possible to give the expected results
- Uses Python3 with the following packages:
    - `numpy`
    - `matplotlib`
    - `scipy`
    - `pandas`
    - `keras` [https://keras.io/#installation]
    - `tensorflow` [https://www.tensorflow.org/install/]
    - `sklearn` [https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html]
    - `pyjet` [https://github.com/scikit-hep/pyjet]

## Answers
Note that one way to implement the code is given in the Answers notebooks. While you are free to look at these along the way, it is beneficial to come up with the answers on your own.

## Data
The data is in the `tutorial_1_data` and `tutorial_2_data` directories, respectively. You should not need to alter anything in here.

## Bugs
Please let me know if there are bugs or typos, so this can be a useful resource for everyone.
